Updated `projections/pipelines/build_features_minutes_v1.py` to coerce ISO-formatted minutes strings into floats before schema enforcement, which unblocked the historical gold rebuild (the labels parquet currently stores minutes as ISO durations). Rebuilt gold features under PROJECTIONS_DATA_ROOT for all partitions with injury/odds coverage: seasons 2022 (Oct–Apr), 2023 (Dec–Apr), and 2024 (Oct–Apr), totaling 19 month partitions (~118k rows). October 2023 and November 2025 remain blocked because the injury snapshots for those months have no rows matching the label game_ids; they will need refreshed snapshots before those gold partitions can be emitted.
