2025-02-14: Added a cvxpy/OSQP-powered team minutes reconciliation layer for minutes_v1. New modules `projections/math/qp_solvers.py` and `projections/minutes_v1/reconcile.py` define the QP solver, config dataclasses, rotation mask, and per-team optimizer with debug hooks. A configurable YAML file `config/minutes_l2_reconcile.yaml` was added along with CLI flags (`--reconcile-team-minutes`, `--reconcile-config`, `--reconcile-debug`) in `projections/cli/score_minutes_v1.py`. Running reconciliation happens after scoring/metadata and recomputes unconditional minutes; quantiles are clamped to maintain monotonicity. Tests live in `tests/minutes_v1/test_reconcile.py` to cover total enforcement, bounds, and rotation masking.
