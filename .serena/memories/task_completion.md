Calibrator changes & status: Updated rolling calibration (anchors, coverage solver for p10/p90, bucket caps/relief, warmup controls, CLI flags) and regenerated October/November features + predictions (cal_inputs_summary shows zero synthetic). Sequential backtest for Dec 2024 rerun with params window_days=28, min_n=400, tau=120, tau_bucket=180, history_months=2, max_abs_delta_p10=0.15, warmup_p10=0, warmup_p90=10, no global p10 anchor. Results: month P10≈0.174 (>0.14), P90≈0.917, 7 days <0.06, Val (Dec25-31) P10≈0.23, P90≈0.865, injury_missing buckets split 0.46 vs 0.09. Unbucketed control still worse (P10≈0.181, 14 low days). Reports live under reports/minutes_v1/2024-12 and reports/minutes_v1/no_buckets/2024-12. Need follow-up on re-centering global delta / dynamic floor to meet guardrails.
