Completed the historical live-data backfill across seasons 2022–2024. Rebuilt daily lineups (bronze/silver) for 2023-24 and 2024-25 (scraper patched to follow redirects when stats.nba.com issues 302s; 2022 relies on migrated parquet). Scraped injuries via `projections.etl.injuries` for Jan–Apr 2023 (season=2022), Jan–Apr 2024 (season=2023), and Oct 2024–Apr 2025 (season=2024) using schedule globs from `silver/schedule/season=YYYY/month=*`. Ran roster nightly ETL loops for seasons 2022–2024 so bronze/silver snapshots exist for every month/day matching the new lineups and injuries. Odds, schedule, and boxscore labels were already complete. Outstanding task: rebuild gold features and run training/parity jobs now that silver layers are aligned.
