# Minutes dashboard status badges
- Added the injury `status` column to the minutes scoring CLI output so the API and dashboard can display player availability directly from the daily parquet artifacts.
- Rendered small status badges next to each player on the React dashboard for Questionable, Probable, Doubtful, GTD, and Out statuses that appear in the minutes feed.
