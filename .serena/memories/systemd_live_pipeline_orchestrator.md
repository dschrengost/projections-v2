Set up a Typer-based live pipeline orchestrator (`projections.cli.live_pipeline`) that runs injuries, daily lineups, odds, and roster nightly ETLs in sequence. Added `scripts/check_live_env.py` and `scripts/run_live_pipeline.sh`, plus systemd service/timer units (hourly, evening, weekend) under `systemd/`. README and `docs/pipeline/live_pipeline_setup.md` now include environment/scheduler instructions.
